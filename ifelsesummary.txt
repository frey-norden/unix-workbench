Summary

    All Bash programs have an exit status. true has an exit status of 0 and false has an exit status of 1.
    Conditional execution uses two operators: AND (&&) and OR (||) which you can use to control what command gets executed based on their exit status.
    Conditional expressions are always in double brackets ([[ ]]). They have an exit status of 0 if they contain a true assertion or 1 if they contain a false assertion.
    IF statements evaluate conditional expressions. If an expression is true then the code within an IF statement is executed, otherwise it is skipped.
    ELIF and ELSE statements also help control the flow of a Bash program, and IF statements can be nested within other IF statements.
