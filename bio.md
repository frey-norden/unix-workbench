### Geography

I am a Texan living in Helsinki, Finland. I am the father of two bilingual chidren, who speak both Swedish and English. I speak a littleFinnish (because this is Finland), a little more Swedish ('cus it's easier to learn for an English-speaker), a little Spanish ('cus yo soy de Tejas), and a couple others too (b/c I am internationally oriented and enjoy learning languages).

### Reading

Some of my favorite readings are:

- *The Tempest* by William Shakespear
- *Theatetus* by Plato
- *Bamse* comics by Rune Andréasson
- *The Bourne Identity* by Robert Ludlum
